This is the main repository to develop a platform to run multiple text simplification algorithms.<br>
Currently the included algorithms are:<br>
1) https://github.com/grammarly/gector <br>
2) https://github.com/senisioi/NeuralTextSimplification <br>
<br>
# Using the tool <br>
Pull the repository from an unix based system and run main.py <br>
The interface will guide you through all of the required steps for training, testing etc. 
For more advanced parameter tweaking it is possible to run both of the algorithms separately by navigating to the desired folder and following the instructions under the desired repositories.
